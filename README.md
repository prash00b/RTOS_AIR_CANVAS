# RTOS_AirCanvas
## _An Air writing shapes prediction_


Real Time Object Tracking and Shape Description Using Aircanvas is a computer-vision neural network project that helps you draw in the air and use the trained CNN (Convolution Neural Network) model to recognise the shapes drawn.



## Features
- Draw something in the in air
- ✨Magic ✨
- Predict the shapes

## Tech

It uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Python] - A versatile programming language used for building applications
- [VS code] - A powerful text editor with features tailored for programming.
- [Camera] - Either a phone camera or a webcam for capturing video.
- [OpenCV] -An open-source computer vision library that will be used for object detection and tracking
- [TensorFlow]- An open-source machine learning framework used for neural network operations.
- [TensorFlow Hub] A repository of pre-trained machine learning models and modules.
- [PIL (Python Imaging Library)]Used for image manipulation and processing tasks.
