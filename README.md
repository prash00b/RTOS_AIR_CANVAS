# RTOS_AirCanvas
## _An Air writing shapes prediction_


Real Time Object Tracking and Shape Description Using Aircanvas is a computer-vision neural network project that helps you draw in the air and use the trained CNN (Convolution Neural Network) model to recognise the shapes drawn.



## Features
- Draw something in the in air
- ✨Magic ✨
- Predict the shapes

## Tech

It uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Python] - A versatile programming language used for building applications
- [VS code] - A powerful text editor with features tailored for programming.
- [Camera] - Either a phone camera or a webcam for capturing video.
- [OpenCV] -An open-source computer vision library that will be used for object detection and tracking
- [TensorFlow]- An open-source machine learning framework used for neural network operations.
- [TensorFlow Hub] A repository of pre-trained machine learning models and modules.
- [PIL (Python Imaging Library)]Used for image manipulation and processing tasks.
- [keras] A high-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow.


##Installation
Install the dependencies
```
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
pip install cvzone
pip install tensorflow
```


##Using the aircanvas
1. Open the aircanvas.py file and run it.
2. Draw on the air with green object by pressing 'd' key for detection mode, after drawing press 'p' key for prediction of shapes.
